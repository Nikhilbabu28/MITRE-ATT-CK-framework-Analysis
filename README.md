# MITRE ATT&CK Framework Analysis Project

## Overview

This project dives into the analysis of cyber threats using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, focusing on threat actors like Wizard Spider and TrickBot, and their interactions with malware such as Emotet and Ryuk. Utilizing the ATT&CK Navigator, I identified common attack techniques and highlighted the importance of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security across various platforms.

## Key Highlights

- **Cyber Threat Analysis:** Detailed examination of threat actors and malware interactions, leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework for a comprehensive threat landscape understanding.
- **ATT&CK Navigator Use:** Employed ATT&CK Navigator to map out and identify prevalent attack techniques, demonstrating a structured approach to cyber threat analysis.
- **Security Advocacy:** Advocated for the adoption of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) as a critical defense mechanism to bolster security measures across different platforms.

## Insights from the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

The MITRE ATT&CK framework serves as an invaluable resource for security teams, offering a lexicon of tactics and techniques used by adversaries. It aids in improving threat visibility, enhancing detection coverage, speeding up investigations, and fostering proactive threat hunting and readiness among security teams. By categorizing attack techniques, the framework provides a structured methodology for understanding and defending against malicious activities.

- **Improved Threat Detection:** Aligning security measures with the ATT&CK framework enhances the ability to detect known attacker behaviors, revealing gaps in defenses.
- **Enhanced Incident Response:** Utilizing the framework accelerates the process of triaging alerts, identifying effective mitigations, and scoping investigations, thereby improving the incident response times.
- **Proactive Threat Hunting:** The framework enables systematic hunting for known adversary behaviors, assisting in uncovering stealthy attacks that may bypass initial defenses.

## Project Repository Contents

- **Analysis Report:** Comprehensive report detailing the cyber threat analysis conducted using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- **ATT&CK Navigator Files:** Files and mappings used within the ATT&CK Navigator to visualize and identify attack techniques and patterns.
- **Security Recommendations:** Document outlining recommended security measures, with a focus on the implementation of MFA to mitigate identified threats.
